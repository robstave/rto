It REALLY does css well

I usually use a Test Driven Design approach.  Is start with a function, and as I add functionality to a function, work it with the test.

With ChatGpt, this does not really work as all the functionality is just thrown out all at once.  I can ask for a test case, but really its more to validate the function after the fact.

so Retroactive Test Catchup ?   I dunno.  Its almost more like when you just right testcases after the fact to make SonarQube
