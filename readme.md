## Introduction

With the increasing emphasis on Return to Office (RTO) policies, keeping track of attendance has become crucial. Companies like Google are mandating up to 5 days in the office, which can be challenging to manage. This project aims to provide a personal dashboard to track your in-office and remote days, including holidays and planned vacations.

## Features

- **Attendance Preferences**: Set your default in-office and remote days for the quarter.
- **Holiday and Vacation Import**: Load a list of holidays and planned vacations from a JSON file.
- **Visual Calendar**: View your schedule with color-coded indicators (green for in-office, red for remote).
- **Dynamic Updates**: Modify your preferences anytime, and the calendar updates accordingly.
- **No Persistence Required**: Focused on functionality without worrying about data persistence for now.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rto-attendance-tracker.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd rto-attendance-tracker
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- **Set Attendance Preferences**

  Go to the preferences page to select the days you plan to be in the office. Check the boxes for Monday through Friday as applicable.

- **Import Holidays and Vacations**

  Prepare a JSON file with your holidays and planned vacations. The application will read this file on load.

- **View Your Schedule**

  The main calendar view will display your in-office days in green and remote days in red.

## Roadmap

- **Data Persistence**

  Implement data storage to save your preferences and events.

**Project Title**: RTO Attendance Tracker

**Objective**: Create a simple web application to track and visualize in-office and remote attendance for the remainder of the quarter, from October 1 to December 31.

### Functional Requirements

1. **Attendance Preferences Page**

   - **Description**: A user interface where users can set their default in-office days.
   - **Inputs**:
     - Checkboxes for each weekday (Monday to Friday).
     - Option to select default attendance (In or Out) for each day.
   - **Behavior**:
     - When a user selects their preferences, the application generates attendance events for each corresponding weekday from the start date to the end date.
     - Changes to preferences update the events accordingly.

2. **Import Holidays and Vacations**

   - **Description**: Load a list of holidays and planned vacations from a JSON file.
   - **File Format**: JSON array containing objects with at least the following fields:
     - `date` (string in ISO format)
     - `eventType` (e.g., "Holiday", "Vacation")
     - `description` (optional)
   - **Behavior**:
     - Upon application load, read the JSON file and incorporate these dates into the attendance events.
     - These events override default attendance preferences for their specific dates.

3. **Calendar View**

   - **Description**: Display a calendar view showing all the days from October 1 to December 31.
   - **Visual Indicators**:
     - **In-Office Days**: Marked in green.
     - **Remote Days**: Marked in red.
     - **Holidays/Vacations**: Displayed with a distinct color or icon.
   - **Behavior**:
     - Reflects the current state based on preferences and imported events.
     - Updates dynamically when preferences are changed.

4. **Event Data Structure**

   - **Fields**:
     - `date` (Date object)
     - `description` (string)
     - `isInOffice` (boolean)
     - `eventType` (string, e.g., "Office", "Remote", "Holiday", "Vacation")
   - **Usage**:
     - Used to generate the calendar view and manage attendance events.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **No Data Persistence Needed**

  - The application does not need to save data between sessions at this stage.

- **User Experience**

  - Simple and intuitive interface.
  - Responsive design to accommodate different screen sizes (optional at this stage).

### Technical Requirements

- **Frameworks and Libraries**

  - Use modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular (choose one).
  - Utilize a UI component library if desired (e.g., Material-UI, Bootstrap).

- **File Handling**

  - Read the holidays and vacations JSON file on application load.
  - Allow the preferences to be saved in-memory or optionally to a file for this session.

### Steps to Implement

1. **Set Up the Project Structure**

   - Initialize the project with the chosen framework.
   - Install necessary dependencies.

2. **Create the Data Models**

   - Define the `Event` struct/class with the specified fields.

3. **Develop the Preferences Page**

   - Build a form with checkboxes for each weekday.
   - Implement the logic to generate events based on selected days.

4. **Implement File Reading for Holidays and Vacations**

   - Write a function to read and parse the JSON file.
   - Merge imported events with the generated attendance events.

5. **Build the Calendar View**

   - Design the calendar layout.
   - Implement logic to display events with appropriate color-coding.

6. **Integrate Components**

   - Ensure that changes in preferences update the calendar view dynamically.
   - Handle any conflicts between default attendance and imported events (e.g., holidays overriding office days).

7. **Testing**

   - Test the application for different preference settings.
   - Validate that holidays and vacations are correctly displayed and override other events.

### Additional Considerations

- **Future Enhancements**

  - Implement data persistence using local storage or a backend.
  - Add user authentication for multiple user support.
  - Allow manual adjustments of individual days on the calendar.

- **Error Handling**

  - Provide user feedback for file reading errors.
  - Validate user inputs on the preferences page.
